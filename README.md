# PurchaseOrderSystem-Web
Technology Stack:
Web App - ReactJS, Firebase
Mobile App (Android) - Java, Firebase
 
The primary objective of this application is to enable site managers to control their procurement of goods directly and independently, without the industry common practice of being reliant upon office-based staff to make orders, which can result in "lost in translation" issues.

The aim of this project is to create a web and a mobile application to provide the site manager with direct access to a company’s purchase order system in order to:
• Generate and place purchase orders.
• Make inquiries about previously placed orders.
• Track orders

And management staff to:
• Approve/Reject purchase orders.
• Add Suppliers/Goods and Site managers to the system
• Assign budgets to sites
